        "\n",
        "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
        "Mean (Arithmetic Average)\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The mean is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values.\n",

        "\n",
        "Description: The median is the middle value when the dataset is ordered from least to greatest. If there’s\n",
        "an even number of values, it is the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "Usage: It represents the middle point of the dataset, which makes it a better measure of central tendency\n",
        "when dealing with skewed distributions or outliers.\n",
        "Mode\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
        "Usage: It’s useful for categorical data or when identifying the most common value in a dataset. A dataset can\n",
